		<h2>Triggers:</h2>
		<p>Written on format:<br>a (bcde)<br>

		</p>
		<h2>Trigger flags:</h2>
		<p>
			-dev: What device ðe key should be pressed on. Doesn’t affect ðe held-down keys. Get device by usiŋ %D in paste or window.<br>
			-exe: What program owns ðe current window. Uses special drive notation, so use %x to get paþ and name. Full paþ required.<br>
			-win: What name ðe current window can have to allow triggeriŋ. Full name required.
		</p>
		<h2>Constants:</h2>
		<p>
			Write #[name] [value];<br>Write all constants first in ðe file. To use, write @[name] somewhere below to make ðe program interpret it as [value].
		</p>
		<h2>Functions:</h2>
		<p>
			paste: Paste a predetermined text. You can also use % + a letter to create a striŋ formatted at runtime (when it is pasted). For example, "paste %H:%M:%S;" will always paste ðe current time of day.<br>
			remap: presses and releases anoðer key when trigger is pressed and released. Can be used to access keys not on your keyboard.<br>
